          </div><b>Welcome to this year's 34th issue of DistroWatch Weekly!</b> Many distributions these days seek to offer an experience which can be described as an easy-to-use Arch Linux. One such project is Liya, an Arch-based distribution that uses the Calamares system installer and the Cinnamon desktop. Jeff Siegel recently took Liya for a test drive and reported on his findings. Read on to learn his thoughts on the distribution in our Feature Story. In our News section we share new performance improvements coming to the Haiku project along with an announcement Gentoo is dropping IA-64 processor support next month. Plus we talk about a major collection of updates coming to Redcore users and challenges this project is facing. This week we also talk about encryption, particularly how to encrypt multiple filesystems on the same hard drive. Do you use full disk or home directory encryption? Let us know in this week's Opinion Poll. Plus we are pleased to share the new releases of the past week and list the torrents we are seeding. We wish you all a fantastic week and happy reading! <br><b>This week's DistroWatch Weekly is presented by <a href="https://distrowatch.com/k/tuxedo.php">TUXEDO Computers</a></b>.

           Most amazing, it's a one-person operation, the work of Sayed M. Hisham, who seems to have put his heart and soul - and who knows what else - into producing Liya. Who else would offer this warning? "<span>Liya Is Not For Users Who ... Are distro-hoppers.</span>" The ISO, download, and installation procedure are as capable as anything from <a href="https://distrowatch.com/fedora">Fedora</a> or <a href="https://distrowatch.com/ubuntu">Ubuntu</a>, and that's not necessarily easy to do.
          <p>So why isn't this this a completely positive review of Liya 2.0 (codenamed Aadnya), after a week or so tinkering with Liya? Because it took me a week to navigate the balky software updater/installer, which kept throwing errors related to a series of corrupted keyring PGP signatures. The instructions for fixing the problem were incomplete and contradictory; I'd do one thing, which didn't work, and then have find another approach, which also didn't work.</p>
          <p>And if one takes a week to figure out how to install new software and update the existing installation, that kind of puts a damper on using Liya, doesn't it?</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, Liya is worth writing about because - assuming Hisham can clean up the documentation - it offers something that seems to fill a need. He understands this, writing that Liya's goal is to provide an Arch-based distro that isn't bloated, works on lower-spec hardware, and combines a clean and efficient interface with quality performance.</p>
          <p><b>Where's the update?</b></p>
          <p>The update and installation flummox was about the last thing I expected after running Liya without any trouble in VirtualBox and then installing it on my test machine. Both went off without a hitch; in fact, it was one of the smoothest VirtualBox sessions I've had when writing a DistroWatch review. The live version of Liya didn't hang up, make the screen go goofy, or any of the rest. It just worked.</p>
          <p>Even better: it took just seven minutes to install the 64-bit Cinnamon desktop edition, which is provided through a 3.6GB ISO (there is also a 4.1GB MATE desktop edition). Requirements are 4GB of RAM, a dual core CPU, and 20GB of hard drive space - hardly overwhelming specs. Liya comes with systemd 256, Cinnamon 6.2.2 and it updates to the 6.10.0-rc6-1 mainline kernel after installation.</p>
          <p>The Calamares installer did what it was supposed to do without any problems, even giving the option to install the distro on an ext4 or Btrfs filesystem (I chose the latter), In fact, it restored my wireless connection and remembered my screen resolution, as well as rebooting without a problem while removing the installation media, which sometimes hangs up with other distros.</p>

           The trouble started when I went to update the system after installation. I ran the Pamac software updater/installer, and got an error: "Failed to commit transaction/Failed to retrieve some files." I messed around with the settings, figuring a repository was set up incorrectly. No joy there, either. So I clicked the Forum desktop icon, which took me to the distro's <a href="https://liyalinux.freeflarum.com/t/wiki">wiki</a>. Listed were three terminal commands to run after installation: refreshing the mirror list and keyring and then updating the system with "sudo pacman -Syu".

           "Ah," I thought, "it's based on Arch, so my Debian-centric mind just didn't understand what needed to be done." But the provided commands from the wiki didn't work, either - the terminal kept spitting out lines about untrusted software keys and didn't do any updating.
          <p>At this point, I thought about moving on, but - to be completely honest - I didn't want to admit that an Arch-based distro had beaten me. So I put Liya away for a day or so, planning to return with a fresh mindset and to undertake some intensive <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a>-ing.</p>
          <p>This process went on for about a week, with no more success. The only related entry in the Liya forum was more than a year old, but didn't offer a solution. And nothing turned up during various Internet searches, save for some hints that the same problem existed with <a href="https://distrowatch.com/kali">Kali Linux</a>,</p>
          <p>And then, for no particular reason, I looked yet again at the almost too spartan Liya website. At the very bottom of the <a href="https://liyalinux.gitlab.io/">home page</a>, there was an 11-step installation guide. I had not paid much attention to it before, since it said to use Rufus to install Liya, and I don't use Windows. But the 11th step was the difference: "<span>After the installation, run fixpacrepo from the terminal.</span>" Which I did, and - save for one remaining annoyance where clicking "shut down" on the menu only logs out - Liya was ready to run as a daily driver.</p>
          <p><b>Software and apps</b></p>
          <p>The Cinnamon desktop works nicely in Liya - no stutters, no hang-ups, and a minimum of spinning wheels after launching an app. Cinnamon extensions are added through a dedicated app, and I installed the weather extension without trouble. And it is light to use, with only 8% on the CPU and 1,400MB of memory used while a YouTube video was running at the same time as a song played on the music player.</p>

           The default applications are a mix of Cinnamon, Arch and its underpinnings, including access to the <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/">AUR</a>, and Hisham's selections. Cinnamon contributions include the Nemo file manager and its Actions Centre; the Pix photo viewer; xed text editor; the GNOME Terminal; and the Celluloid video player. Hisham has chosen Brave as the browser, Geary as the e-mail client, and the free version of OnlyOffice as the office suite. Also included are the Ulauncher application launcher; Vim, for those who prefer that sort of thing; Deluge for BitTorrent; Bleachbit (for the intrepid); and Exaile for music.
          <p>Brave and OnlyOffice are intriguing choices, though Ulauncher and Geary aren't common, either. Brave seemed to work as it was supposed to, though it didn't seem any lighter than Firefox. I know OnlyOffice a little (I've worked my way through most office suites, free and paid, in a vain attempt to liberate myself from LibreOffice's annoyances), and it's fine, but not appreciably different from LibreOffice. Geary, thanks to Google's security witchcraft, wouldn't recognize the Gmail account I use for these reviews, so it was easier to set up a Brave progressive web app (<a href="https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/how-to-use-progressive-web-apps">PWA</a>) and run Gmail through it. Ulauncher was a pleasant surprise, though I wish it was as easy to set up to access files and documents as it is on the Albert launcher.</p>

           One word here about Hardinfo2, a system information and benchmark utility. Usually, one of the Neofetch clones suffices for my purposes, but Hardinfo2 is much more complete, offers the information in a user-friendly way, and allowed me to run fun, if useless, benchmarks for my older test machine.
          <p>In the end, the problems with Liya aren't about the distro itself, which is so simple to use it's almost as if it's not based on Arch. Believe it or not, there's as little need to use the command line as there is on Ubuntu. And yes, I can see using it on my older hardware as a daily driver, even though it likely does far more than I need it to do. That it was a rolling release also didn't seem to matter. Once I got everything working, nothing gummed up or to acted wonky.</p>
          <p>Rather, the problem is - sadly - typical of so many one-person and small group Linux efforts. There's so much to do in just building the damned thing that so much else falls through the cracks. Yes, I probably should have found the instructions to run <i>fixpacrepo</i> to rebuild the repos and update the GPG keys sooner than I did. And, almost certainly, an Arch devotee would have known to do it as matter of course.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, for anyone coming to Arch from elsewhere, which seems to be one of Liya's goals, one set of accurate and complete instructions located in every place anyone would look - home page, wiki, forum, whatever - is necessary, even if it's a lot of work. That's one of the basics in running a distro. Hopefully, Hisham can take that next step, since Liya deserves all the attention it can get.</p>

I also implemented userspace-only profiling (ignoring kernel stack frames entirely), fixed some output buffer sizing issues, and fixed a race condition in thread resumption that also affected strace. While it isn't perfect, it's much better than before, and can now be used to profile applications and the kernel to see where CPU time is being spent; and notably it now checks the thread's CPU time counters to detect if it 'missed' profiling ticks, and if so how many.</span>"</p>

As mentioned above, pushing frequent updates is easy, producing a new release, not so much.

         <td><b><u>Dual boot with encryption</u></b> <b>Shields-up asks:</b> How can I make it so the files from one Linux distro on my laptop can't be accessed by another distro on the same laptop? I only have one hard drive in the laptop.
          <p><b>DistroWatch answers:</b> When you are trying to protect one operating system from another on the same hardware, you pretty much need to use encryption. Depending on which files you want to protect, you might take different approaches to using encryption. For instance, if you are only worried about protecting your user's files (data stored under your home directory) then you could use user directory encryption or encrypt the <i>/home</i> partition only. However, if you are worried about one operating system compromising another, not just reading the contents of private data on the filesystem, then you'll need full disk/partition encryption.</p>
          <p>The challenge we then face is few distribution system installers make it easy to set up multiple distributions on the same hard drive, both with encrypted root filesystems. Some projects, such as <a href="https://distrowatch.com/ubuntu">Ubuntu</a>, make it easy to wipe an entire drive and encrypt the operating system's disk, but they don't really offer a smooth way to install two operating systems side-by-side, with both of them encrypted. It's generally assumed that if you want to protect your operating system's data using encryption, then you won't install a second operating system which might be used to compromise it.</p>
          <p>There are a few suggestions I can make for working around this assumption.</p>
          <p>The first and easiest option is to set up your preferred distribution normally with full disk encryption. Then install your second distribution inside a virtual machine running on the original (host) distribution. This won't, technically, provide dual boot capabilities, so if that is something you really need this won't help. However, in the vast majority of cases, installing a distribution in a virtual machine and using full disk encryption in the VM is the most practical way to go. The host won't see the encrypted files inside the virtualized guest and the guest won't see the host's files.</p>
          <p>The only situations where this will not work are if you really need the second operating system to have direct access to the hardware or you have an extremely limited amount of RAM available.</p>
          <p>Another option would be to plug in an external hard drive to your laptop. Then install one distribution per drive, each of them using full disk encryption. Most laptops will boot from an external drive and that way each distro can have its own disk. For added security, when not using the distribution on the external drive, you could unplug it, guaranteeing the distro on the internal drive can't see the second distro at all.</p>
          <p>The performance of the distro on the second drive will be reduced when reading from the disk, and you'll have some up front costs for the external drive, but this is probably the easiest approach if you absolutely need to dual boot.</p>
          <p>Since most system installers do not handle setting up dual-boot, encrypted operating systems gracefully, a third option is to do the disk partitioning and encrypting ourselves. We can set up encrypted disk partitions manually and then try to install our distribution of choice into the encrypted volume. This usually only works well with highly manual distributions, such as <a href="https://distrowatch.com/arch">Arch Linux</a> or in cases where the user knows how to set up a distribution manually using a live media. However, for those who are brave enough to go this route and want full control, the Arch wiki has tutorials for <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dm-crypt/Encrypting_an_entire_system">setting up encrypted partitions, ZFS, and LVM volumes</a>.</p>
          <p>This last option is certainly the most complex and involves the most work. However, if the situation really requires dual booting, full filesystem encryption, and cannot involve a second hard drive, this is probably the best option left to you.</p>

"<span>Fixed problems: Persistent storage: Increase the maximum waiting time to 4 minutes when unlocking the Persistent Storage before returning an error. Made the creation of the Persistent Storage more robust after starting a Tails USB stick for the first time. Prevent the Persistent Storage settings from freezing after opening a link to the documentation. Prevent Additional Software from crashing when installing virtual packages. Networking: Fix connecting to the Tor network using default bridges. Allow enabling multiple network interfaces again.</span>" The <a href="https://tails.net/news/version_6.6/index.en.html">release announcement</a> offers additional information.</p>

          <p>The <a href="https://distrowatch.com/deepin">deepin</a> distribution is based on Debian and features the custom-made Deepin Desktop Environment (Deepin DE). The project's latest release is version 23 which introduces atomic updates and support for a wider range of CPU architectures. The new CPU support includes install media and packages for ARM and RISC-V processors. "<span>The system repository packages have been comprehensively upgraded to enhance stability and security, and better support new hardware and architectures such as ARM64, RISC-V, and LoongArch64. Established a new V23 repository for the upgrade of over 8,000 core packages. Introduced a new installation and upgrade mechanism to reduce disk space occupation during whole disk installation. Provided a flexible upgrade backup mechanism to ensure user rollback capability in case of upgrade anomalies, and offered users the ability to manage multiple versions. Optimized system backup solutions to reduce disk space usage compared to the previous A/B partition scheme. Added the "Atomic Update" capability, allowing users to flexibly roll back or switch system versions based on backup restore points.</span>" Additional details can be found in the project's <a href="https://www.deepin.org/en/deepin-v23-is-officially-released/">release announcement</a>.</p>

The project's latest release, ExTiX 24.8, is based on deepin 23. "<span>New functions etc. in ExTiX 24.8 'Deepin': 1. VirtualBox Guest Additions are not pre-installed. No real need for them since you can run ExTiX in full screen in VirtualBox by just changing the screen resolution. 2. You can run ExTiX from RAM. Use boot alternative 2 (load to RAM) or Advanced. A wonderful way to run Linux if you have enough RAM. Everything will be super fast. When ExTiX has booted up you can remove the DVD or USB stick. 3. You can use Deepin Installer as an alternative to Refracta Installer. Use Deepin Installer preferable on UEFI computers if you want/need to install or reinstall GRUB. 4. I have installed Google Chrome 127.0.6533.119-1 as a replacement for Deepin's Browser, which suddenly can be in Chinese. 5. I've added Synaptic Package Manager. A must I think. Watch a screenshot when Synaptic is running. 6. You can watch Netflix while running Google Chrome....</span>" Additional details can be found in the project's <a href="https://www.extix.se/extix-deepin-24-8-live-based-on-deepin-23-stable-latest-with-refracta-snapshot-and-kernel-6-10-3-amd64-exton-build-240816/">release announcement</a>.</p>

When it comes to protecting data there are a few approaches people can take. One is to encrypt everything on the disk, including the operating system and user files. Some people prefer to just encrypt the data files under their account. Others may not encrypt any parts of the filesystem and, instead, use encrypted file vaults for sensitive information. We'd like to hear which approach to encryption you use.

I guess you could say, in our case, the very OS is the actual encryption. <br>

          <p>That's not an absolute, it's conditional on hardware being sufficiently new to support AES-NI or an equivalent instruction set. For people that still rock, e.g., first-gen Core i7 CPUs (like the one in the otherwise still quite usable with its 32GiB RAM and SSD ThinkPad W510 I have) disk encryption does slow down the system noticeably enough. And it not only causes the disk I/O to be slower than it would be otherwise, but it also takes away CPU cycles from the rest of the software. Still, depending on the workload the system can still remain quite usable even then.</p><br>

          <p>First, no you don't need a newer computer/CPU to run encrypiton without a noticeable performance penalty. Second, there must be something else affecting your machine, it's not going to be the encryption.</p>
          <p>I can run encryption on a 15 year old laptop with a spinning drive, 4GB of RAM and i3 processor in it with no performance hit. There is no way you're seeing a slow down due to encryption on anything made in the last decade or so.</p><br>

           As long as you’re perfectly comfortable with burglars or hackers browsing through all of your data, sharing your photos, reading your emails and using them to impersonate you, and so on and so on, it can indeed make sense to avoid encryption as it can involve a very small cost (depending on your implementation) in terms of speed and/or ease of data recovery.
          <p>On the other hand if you’re not completely comfortable with the contents of your computer being fully available to anyone who wants to use them for any purpose, it would be ridiculous not to implement something so easy and with so much flexibility (you can encrypt anything from physical drives to single files… including encrypting large single files that you can then mount as drives full of directories and data).</p>
          <p>It’s maybe possible that the 71% of poll respondents who don’t use encryption at all genuinely don’t need it… but I bet some of them are just counting foolishly on good luck. They may regret it when their laptops are lost or stolen and they suddenly realize that their login password couldn’t stop a competent 7-year-old and their digital lives are now anyone’s for the taking. Especially if they were foolish enough to allow their browsers to save their online passwords too, on unencrypted systems that allow anyone to launch those browsers as if they were the owner! Some folk seem to go through life with an irrational “it won’t happen to me” filter: it certainly does happen, so if you don’t want it to happen to you, use encryption.</p><br>

           OK, I am convinced by the need to encrypt more of my "home" directory. At present I just use a symmetric AES file encryption for files containing "secrets". The only complication of is that I use a semi-custom filesystem Mirror based on Lsyncd for my "home" directory. I might have to create some new software to realise this.

           For pain-free setup, make /boot a cleartext partition, encrypt the rest. Nearly all of the supposed "pain" of encryption revolves around bootloader issues. So /boot should be cleartext ext4 minus journaling. Bye bye bootloader hassle. The /boot files are not your personal work or configs anyway. Leaving /boot as cleartext is a rational trade-off. Technically you could stash /boot on a separate USB key, just as you could a keyfile.
          <p>I never let installers partition disks, but use gdisk, and often make my own filesystems too. Installer options are too limited and outdated. Installers still enable swap needlessly. The best advise on /swap is not using it. And I *always* turn off ext4 journaling. That change makes ext4 faster and more stable. Installers don't present the option.</p>
          <p>The minimum to encrypt: /root, /home, and /etc, which encompass $HOME, $XDG_CONFIG_HOME, and $XDG_DATA_HOME for all users. Yet encrypting everything is easier than such cherry-picking.</p>
          <p>Backup is simple with ddrescue. Create an image of the encrypted partition on another drive. That image is equally encrypted and mountable as a filesystem. This method is neither space-efficient nor maximally fast, but trivial, and makes recovery so. To get an old file, mount the image and copy the file out. To restore in full, ddrescue the whole (unmounted) image back to the (unmounted) source partition. You can finish a full system backup (all partitions) in under an hour, give or take.</p>
          <p>The world needs encryption more in communications. Distros should package the superb SimpleX Chat app which covers all platforms and phones. There's even an AppImage. The home page lags development, so get releases from GitHub. Currently 6.0.1 is the latest.</p>

           A "ridiculously slower laptop" is not encryption's fault: that's just user error. If 95% of a drive's contents are files downloaded from distro servers and installed from packages then those are publicly available files so to waste time encrypting and decrypting them is more likely to be a mistake than a real need for that level of security. When it comes to encrypting all of home, that's more reasonable because a lot of data can be hiding in hidden directories that users don't know about... but users who are familiar with the contents of their home directories can usually encrypt a single secure folder and pop anything sensitive in there... it has zero impact on system performance.
          <p>As for the "Great Green Lie", you must be living in an unusually dangerous neighbourhood, or else perhaps basing your opinion on reporting (which, obviously, chases ratings with an endless parade of crime) rather than stats. New Zealand is consistently ranked as one of the safest and least corrupt nations in the world: the US, for example, has a much higher crime rate. Knowing how safe this country is relative to others doesn't change the fact that laptops are often stolen from public places, here as in other countries, desktops are occasionally stolen in burglaries, and everything on the Internet is an attack surface for people in much less safe nations (China, Nigeria, etc.) to get their hands on whatever they can.</p>
          <p>It's not just a matter of personal privacy: anyone with clients and legal obligations to protect client data or commercially sensitive data and so on definitely needs encryption. I still think most of the people who said they're not using any encryption probably should be (or they are already, because they're just playing with Linux and are using encryption on their Windows or Mac boxes). But if you don't need it, cool: like I said, if you don't really need it then it makes sense not to use it, as things are simpler without it. Most people though, if they're using their computers in the real world, do need it and should be using it.</p><br>

           I am not against the idea of encrypting and I think businesses should definitely do it but for myself, I have a couple dozen computers at home and nothing on any of them is of any concern that I would be worried about it being lost or stolen, anything important is kept on removable media on multiple backups, and any serious internet usage(banking,payments,etc.)I do through secure anonymous browsing with nothing saved beyond that session so I just never seen the point in personal encrypting at home. So honestly in 24 years of linux usage I have never even once played with encryption, maybe I should try it out sometime just to have the experience with it if it ever comes up but I seriously have no opinion on the tools for it. <br>

          <p>Fair point. Now carry that thought to its logical conclusion: package cache belongs in tmpfs regardless of encryption. Putting it on disk at all is bad engineering. You want performance? Then why write packages to disk at all? Keep them in RAM, where they were first downloaded anyway, use them from RAM, and delete them from RAM. They are deadweight after installation. Save disk write time and space! RAM is 100x faster and erases itself at shutdown. Most distros have an env var to set cache location. It should be tmpfs by default. All distros would boost performance and free disk space with this change.</p>
          <p>The encryption story changes after installation. Once the package is installed and running, configuration files hold sensitive data. Even library files, with the right network hack, evil maid, or government backdoor, could be compromised. Think about replacing glibc with a backdoored version. Nobody steals your laptop. Someone just inserts a USB key and copies a file to it while you took a bathroom break at the airport. The attack comes over the Internet weeks later. Or the enemy might be your kid's school chum doing it in your own house. Your lack of encryption enabled this attack.</p>
          <p>Official packages are threats too! Recently the humble xz compression library was caught. Heartbleed lived in the SSL lib. Online banking activity was wide open. Anyone with 5ki11z could have written JavaScript to read your disk through an "secure" website. Lately the entire US Social Security database was lifted. Ransomware is everywhere. Threats exist whether you imagine yourself living with safe people, or on safe property, or not. Assuming that you know in advance what form and fashion future attacks will take is hubris.</p>
          <p>Businesses have this hubris in spades and are dumb as rocks. Few have security oversight officers. People don't want to bother. They want an easy-peasy, unencrypted, "paperless" work life. I once contracted with a European concern. It asked me to scan and transmit official IDs and bank statements as image attachments to e-mail. I told them that request was extremely stupid and no, I would not do it. That set of files is everything a thief needs to rob me blind. I would mail paper copies. Businesses want to go "paperless" and think it's very clever and efficient and hip. Sensitive document scans, whether sitting on disk or transmitted, need encryption.</p>
          <p>Those afraid of OS disk encryption might want to use Tomb for sensitive files or current work. The latest Tomb is 2.11, Void is at 2.10, Debian stable at 2.9, Debian sid at 2.11.</p><br><a href="https://dyne.org/tomb/">https://dyne.org/tomb/</a> <br>

          <p>This isn't a good idea as it means you can't access/use the packages later if you want them. For example, to re-install or downgrade a package. You'd need to fetch them over again, which is going to be a problem if an update broke your network connection.</p>
          <p>"You want performance? Then why write packages to disk at all? Keep them in RAM, where they were first downloaded anyway, use them from RAM, and delete them from RAM."</p>
          <p>This already happens automatically. Files downloaded and saved to the disk are cached in memory. It doesn't speed up anything to put the files in tmpfs because they're already cached. Writing to the disk just saves the packages for later use/querying.</p>
          <p>"All distros would boost performance and free disk space with this change."</p>
          <p>They'd save a few megabytes of disk space, which no one is going to notice. But there wouldn't be any performance boost due to the caching in RAM.</p><br>

I never need to fallback to some old version. It's a trope in my opinion as a software engineer. I don't know why so many devs are stuck on the idea. Maybe your personal use case as a regular distro tester is unique.
          <p>Caching in tmpfs does not happen automatically. If you mean disk cache, yes hard drives have that, and SSDs are another ball of wax. Eventually there is a physical write to physical disk media (and SSD writes are notoriously slow compared to HDD platters). If you mean RAM cache related to the file system, it's exactly the same story. Eventually a disk write (flush) happens. Only if you tell the distro to *store* packages in tmpfs will you avoid disk writes to actual media.</p>
          <p>And unattended cache can easily eat gigabytes. The typical n00b will never clean it. I have in the past found myself shocked at the wasted space on my own systems.</p>
          <p>Even as a software engineer who distrohops and runs Ventoy I have never, repeat never, not once, *ever* needed to fall back to an old version of *anything*. If that need occurs, the upstream distro itself reverts users to the old version via the package manager. It has happened e.g. in Void with the recent xz fiasco.</p>
          <p>Ultimately one can carry the off Internet logic to its own conclusion too. If lack of Internet is anticipated, one should maintain a full rsync copy of the entire distro repo. You know, all 2 terabytes. After all, you never know what app you might want to install when your Internet is off. These hypotheticals get silly. In practice nobody needs a package cache on disk. It's bad engineering these days. When RAM was small things were different, and that was also when we still needed swap.</p><br>

          <p>You appeal to your supposed authority, namely to your supposed experience[d user] and software engineer status. Appeal to authority is a common fallacy, yet you consistently do it, which is just all the more proof that your supposed labels mean nothing. It's also funny how you, a supposed software engineer don't know what caching Jesse was referring to, or at least you pretend not to understand it.</p>
          <p>&gt; I never need to [...] in my opinion as a software engineer. I don't know why [...] Maybe your personal use case as a regular distro tester is unique.</p>
          <p>Your ignorance and faulty thought process shine here. You call out Jesse for mentioning his own use-case, while you keep referring to your use-case as if it mattered anything *in general*. It doesn't. And if it did, so did Jesse's. (Also, look up the Linux-related software Jess has or is maintaining, compare that to your "experience", and then decide who has more "authority" to make fact-based statements in these topics.)</p>
          <p>It's also funny you try to justify your *opinion* with your recurring label ("software engineer"). No offense, but what kind of engineer does that? =)The "I don't know why" and the "maybe" also speak for themselves, you seem to have only ideas, but little relevant knowledge in the field.</p>
          <p>&gt; and SSD writes are notoriously slow compared to HDD platters</p>
          <p>I must have misunderstood you, but it seems you think SSDs are slower than traditional HDDs. Is that what you meant?</p>
          <p>&gt; And unattended cache can easily eat gigabytes.</p>
          <p>For which there is at least an order of magnitude more space on the hard drive than in memory. Not everyone has your fancy "software engineer" machine with zettabytes of memory, especially not people with "older hardware". Also, the RAM being much smaller than the hard-drive means the RAM will fill up much faster (with your idea of caching everything there), which just defeats the (/your) whole purpose.</p>
          <p>&gt; Even as a software engineer [..] I have never, repeat never, not once, *ever* needed to</p>
          <p>Again, appeal to authority, and appeal to your own needs as if it were the needs of others or as if they proved any technical point. (They aren't and they don't.)</p>
          <p>&gt; Ultimately one can carry the off Internet logic</p>
          <p>Slippery slope "argument"; apparently you still lack any real arguments.</p>
          <p>&gt; one should maintain a full rsync copy of the entire distro repo. You know, all 2 terabytes.</p>
          <p>Not even close. You would need a basic set of packages, including drivers for our hardware. Most of the popular disrtibutions provide them on their live discs, and if not, you could just download them and write them to a USB key. Again, you make faulty and ridiculous statements to try and prove your point, but again, it shows your ignorance and faulty thinking.</p>
          <p>&gt; These hypotheticals get silly.</p>
          <p>Your hypotheticals get silly. Also, labelling legit concerns as "hypotheticals" is not an argument.</p>
          <p>&gt; In practice nobody needs a package cache on disk.</p>
          <p>"In practice" means "some (maybe many) people do, but I want you to forget that, because that would reveal I'm wrong". Also, you forgot to prove your statement.</p>
          <p>&gt; It's bad engineering these days.</p>
          <p>Except when it isn't. Hard disk space is way cheaper (and therefore way more plentiful) than RAM, therefore it makes sense to use it for caching the latest version of any installed packages, because the cost is so little. With companies with their own package caches/proxies, it is almost mandatory. (Red Hat Satellite comes to mind.) By the way, while it's anecdotal, my Mint install seems to only store a single deb package in the cache right now, so I wonder how many desktop distros cahce packages these days. If not many, then your assumption about disks getting full is even less likely; if many of them, your argument about no one needing it is false. :)</p>
          <p>Also "bad engineering" is silly coming from an "engineer" with incredulously faulty thinking, wrong assumptions, false statements, statements without proof, appealing to authority, using anecdotal "evidence" and an insufferable amount of ego. Please, less hubris, more facts, more logic. (If you won't stop making yourself look bad, please at least stop engineers look bad.)</p><br>

           @37: " I never need to fallback to some old version. It's a trope in my opinion as a software engineer. "
          <p>So because you don't use a feature in your job you feel it's not a feature anyone would use in any job? That seems a bit narrow in focus. I can tell you, as a system administrator, it's often handy to be able to rollback packages. Perhaps broadening your view to what other people want/need would shine light on what features make sense in a distribution.</p>
          <p>"Maybe your personal use case as a regular distro tester is unique."</p>
          <p>Do you think my entire career in IT for the past 25 years has just been reviewing a new distro every week?</p>
          <p>"Caching in tmpfs does not happen automatically. If you mean disk cache, yes hard drives have that, and SSDs are another ball of wax."</p>
          <p>I'm not talking about using tmpfs or disk cache. I'm talking about how all files the operating system accesses (downloads or reads) are kept in memory. All the files you open (or download) are kept in RAM. tmpfs for files you plan to just download and access once is redundant.</p>
          <p>"If you mean RAM cache related to the file system, it's exactly the same story. Eventually a disk write (flush) happens. Only if you tell the distro to *store* packages in tmpfs will you avoid disk writes to actual media."</p>
          <p>Yes, eventually the package gets written to the disk, but that's not a problem. The disk won't be the bottleneck when downloading new software and updates, the network connection will be. Also, you're going to end up writing to the disk eventually when you install the package (probably to /usr or /opt). One way or another, data is going to end up on the disk. tmpfs just adds an extra step you don't need to set up due to automatic RAM caching.</p>
          <p>"And unattended cache can easily eat gigabytes."</p>
          <p>Modern drives are in the range of 500GB to 8TB. You can easily update a distribution for years without ever noticing the few GB of space that might get consumed.</p>
          <p>"Even as a software engineer who distrohops and runs Ventoy I have never, repeat never, not once, *ever* needed to fall back to an old version of *anything*."</p>
          <p>Again, you're assuming your needs and experiences match everyone else's. But we have different jobs. Your needs are not my needs and vice versa.</p>
          <p>"Ultimately one can carry the off Internet logic to its own conclusion too. If lack of Internet is anticipated, one should maintain a full rsync copy of the entire distro repo. You know, all 2 terabytes. After all, you never know what app you might want to install when your Internet is off."</p>
          <p>Now you're just being silly. I pointed out it's possible to have one key package break during an update (like Network Manager) and it's handy in those cases to be able to revert from the cache immediately, instead of re-fetching the package on another machine or recovering using live media. Can you think of a better/faster way to recover than having the last version in the cache?</p>
          <p>"These hypotheticals get silly."</p>
          <p>Your extreme version of caching the entire repo, instead of just packages the system is actually using is certainly silly. Why would anyone cache packages that aren't installed?</p>
          <p>"In practice nobody needs a package cache on disk"</p>
          <p>This is factually wrong. Lots of people do. It's just _you_ don't and you don't acknowledge the use cases of others.</p><br>

          <p>I find it equally shocking that 75% of the respondents don't encrypt anything. I wish them the best and maybe where they are there just isn't a need for encryption. I wish I lived there. But I live in 'realville.' In realville we have to have our dukes up. My world is full of a lot of bad actors who daily seem to be ever more intent of getting at our stuff.</p>
          <p>And I am ever more intent on keeping those bad actors at bay.</p>

Just leave the keys in the ignition too. Let folks rummage through your purse too and leave your wallet on the bar while you to go to the bathroom.</p>

      <p>Exe GNU/Linux</p>
      <p></p><br>
       Exe GNU/Linux is a Debian-based desktop Linux distribution. Its primary goal is to provide a Debian variant that ships with a slightly re-themed Trinity desktop environment (a fork of KDE 3), as well as several useful scripts and utilities. It offers LXDE as an alternative desktop. It uses the official Debian repositories, as well as the Trinity mirror for updating the desktop environment. In late 2017, the distribution re-based itself on Devuan, using the official Devuan repositories.
