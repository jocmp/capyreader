            <media:description>This one slipped through the reviewing net when it released owing to a packed holiday season schedule, but we simply had to go back and take a look at it! John teams up with Marc 'Try4ce' Duddleson to take a look at the new Soul Reaver 1 and 2 Remasters, stacked up against the Dreamcast and PS2 versions respectively. These are excellent remasters, well worth a look. Want some DF-branded tee-shirts, mugs, hoodies and various items based on DF catchphrases?

            <media:description>Lots of requests for this one, so here we go! Black Myth: Wukong recently received a new patch that looks to address some of the issues with the original PS5 version and adds in PS5 Pro support. So has Game Science sorted the rather odd technical decisions that impacted the PS5 game? Is the Pro support actually worthwhile? Oliver takes a look, finding an improved game - albeit with some bizarre oddities - like frame-gen still used for 60fps gaming on both PS5 and Pro.

            <media:description>With an official announcement for Nintendo Switch 2 due in the next month or so, it's perhaps no surprise to see the leaks coming in thick and fast - but how believable are they? Meanwhile, Oliver gets to grips with the latest patch for Alan Wake 2 on PS5 Pro - is there genuine improvement? Rich tries to piece together the latest RTX 50-series rumours into something coherently plausible, while John examines the latest Switch IP-abusing shovelware: the mighty Monkey Kong in New-York.

            <media:description>The Final Fantasy series has a long and storied history with the PlayStation brand, so it is no surprise to see that the latest game - Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth - benefits immensely from an upgrade on Sony's latest machine: PS5 Pro. Oliver goes into depth on the changes to the game - good and bad - then circles back to see how Game Boost benefits the likes of Final Fantasy 16, Final Fantasy 14 and Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin. Plus, he takes look at other FF titles to round off the piece. Want some DF-branded tee-shirts, mugs, hoodies and various items based on DF catchphrases?

            <media:description>One of the most technologically impressive games of the year, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is one of the few games that requires hardware accelerated ray tracing in order to function. Looking good on everything from Xbox Series S to the maxed-out, path-traced RTX 4090 experience, RT takes centrestage. Alex talks with MachineGames about the technology behind the game.

            <media:description>As one of the year's surprise hits, Space Marine 2 receives a PS5 Pro upgrade that attempts to address two key issues with the base PS5 game: its performance at 60fps, and its image quality in that very same mode. The turnout for Pro hardware owners is a pleasing one overall - especially with PSSR in place to assist matters - but there is still a performance gap in locking down a solid 60fps.

            <media:description>Opting out of PSSR, Guerrilla Games has outfitted Horizon Forbidden West and Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered with its own upscaling solution. Oliver and Alex share notes on the upscaler and its remarkable image quality, all the modes are analysed and thanks to sterling work from Nixxes, we can compare Guerrilla's upscaler with PC mainstays FSR 3.1 and, of course, Nvidia DLSS.

            <media:description>Alert status is elevated to GEOFFCON 1 as we react to the major reveals - and other games that caught our attention - at The Game Awards 2024. What can we learn from The Witcher 4's cinematic trailer and the RTX 5090 that powered it? Is Intergalactic from Naughty Dog really rendering in real-time at 4K 60 with ray tracing? How good does Mafia: The Old Country look and just how wonderful was Split Fiction? Does Elden Ring Nightreign exhibit any evidence of technical progression whatsoever? All this and more in the new Direct, plus Oliver's analysis of the new PS5 Pro updates for Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora and Star Wars Outlaws.

            <media:description>It wasn't too long ago that path-tracing in games was limited to just old retro titles... but these days, the latest triple-A titles benefit from some transformative RT - and so it is with the Full RT upgrade for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.
