            <description>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is alerting health care professionals
                of a voluntary recall of morphine sulfate 0.5 mg/mL preservative free in 0.9% sodium
                chloride, 1 mL syringe, CII, for intravenous use made and distributed by Pharmakon
                Pharmaceuticals, in Noblesville, Indiana, because the product is super-potent.
                Pharmakon initiated the voluntary recall on February 11, 2016, after receiving
                laboratory results showing the product was super-potent.
