                <ul>
                    <li>Sandboxed Google Play compatibility layer: remove StatsManager from hidden
                        services and replace that approach with stubbing out all of the methods
                        since Play services recently introduced new code using it that's missing a
                        null check and triggers a null pointer exception which has blocked us from
                        pushing out the newer versions of Play services beyond our App Store's Alpha
                        channel
                    </li>
                    <li>Network Location: switch to making at most a single request to the service
                        per position estimation by requesting up to 40 Wi-Fi APs at once
                    </li>
                    <li>Network Location: optimize making requests to the service for Wi-Fi AP
                        data
                    </li>
                    <li>Network Location: optimize Rust JNI bindings to the point that it no longer
                        causes a noticeable overhead without introducing unsafe code (it could be
                        optimized further with unsafe code to cache more JNI binding work but the
                        difference is insignificant so we don't plan to do it)
                    </li>
                    <li>Network Location: use correct Accept header value to more closely match
                        macOS to avoid future compatibility issues
                    </li>
                    <li>fix upstream system_server crash from null pointer exception in F2fsUtils
                    </li>
                    <li>add infrastructure for more restricted access to global and per-user
                        settings instead of allowing all system apps to read them and all privileged
                        systems apps with the WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS privileged permission to write
                        them
                    </li>
                    <li>further restrict access to all global and per-user settings added by
                        GrapheneOS with our new infrastructure
                    </li>
                    <li>replace disabling the unused ADD_USERS_WHEN_LOCKED and
                        ENABLE_EPHEMERAL_FEATURE settings at boot with a new approach of making
                        settings immutable in the code, which we can expand in the future to other
                        problematic settings not used by GrapheneOS
                    </li>
                    <li>kernel (6.1): update to latest GKI LTS branch revision including update to
                        6.1.131
                    </li>
                    <li>kernel (6.1): drop revert for upstream USB fix causing DisplayPort alternate
                        mode regression due to another upstream patch successfully fixing it
                    </li>

                <p>Changes since the 2025032100 release:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Network Location: rewrite position estimation in Rust (from Kotlin) with a
                        new algorithm based on Expectation-Maximization (EM) always using 3D
                        (altitude) to provide much better accuracy, robustness and performance (this
                        new 3D implementation performs better than the previous implementation in
                        the 2D mode we were stuck using due to 3D being far too CPU intensive)
                    </li>
                    <li>Network Location: improve RSSI-based (signal strength) distance estimation
                        including tuning it separately for 2.4GHz vs. 5GHz/6GHz and take distance
                        variance into account for position estimation (Wi-Fi Round-Trip-Time support
                        will be added in the future for Access Points supporting it)
                    </li>
                    <li>Network Location: add support for 6GHz Wi-Fi networks via Reduced Neighbor
                        Report (RNR)
                    </li>
                    <li>Network Location: increase the number of closest APs we explicitly request
                        data for from 5 to 15
                    </li>
                    <li>Network Location: request data for up to 4 APs at a time instead of only 1
                        to improve networking efficiency
                    </li>
                    <li>Network Location: make our requests more closely match a current macOS
                        release to avoid future compatibility issues and to get Apple's service to
                        provide more than only 2.4GHz networks as nearby networks in response to
                        queries
                    </li>
                    <li>Network Location: reduce requesting data for 100 additional nearby Wi-Fi APs
                        down to 8 APs when a decent amount of additional results were returned from
                        a recent request for up to 100 in the past 10 seconds
                    </li>
                    <li>backport upstream brightness fluctuation fix from Android 16 Beta 3.1</li>
                    <li>Sandboxed Google Play compatibility layer: fix Location Accuracy link with
                        Play services 25.09 and later so we can ship it as an update for users with
                        sandboxed Google Play installed
                    </li>
                    <li>Sandboxed Google Play compatibility layer: remove no longer supported
                        "Configure Play Store updates" settings since we always handle updates
                        ourselves via our App Store now
                    </li>
                    <li>fix an upstream screenshot process crash in ScrollCaptureController</li>
                    <li>Terminal (virtual machine management app): backport upstream improvements
                        including detecting an outdated image to providing an upgrade path and
                        removing the artificial cap on disk resize
                    </li>

                        since it's useful for development
                    </li>
                    <li>add support for testing Android 16 Beta 3 feature flags for development

                        to compatibility issues (this should fix a recent Play services crash that's

                    with many backports from the Android Open Source Project main branch. You'll

                    continue to be treated as disposable rather than relying on it not losing it
                    from a bug or a backwards incompatible update.

                        reimplementation of the Google Play location service (location request
                        rerouting) to provide much better compatibility for apps depending on

                        Location Accuracy toggle is enabled and providing fallback to GNSS for low
                        power location requests when the OS network location service is disabled as
                        it is by default (unlike Google Play services, which has no fallback, but
                        apps assume users enable the feature)
                    </li>
                    <li>fix Storage Scopes related null pointer exception in the permissions

                        to avoid crashes when the name is set to an empty value or whitespace
                    </li>
                    <li>Terminal (virtual machine management app): backport a large set of
                        improvements including terminal tabs, working port forwarding, GUI support
                        with opt-in GPU hardware acceleration (ANGLE-based VirGL until GPU
                        virtualization support is available), speaker/microphone support and fixes
                        for a bunch of bugs including overly aggressive timeouts
                    </li>
                    <li>Settings: add Terminal app toggle to System category when developer options
                        are enabled (requirement will be dropped when it's no longer experimental)
                        so it can be enabled in other users (it's still currently only possible to
                        use 1 instance at a time due to conflicting use of an internal network
                        specific to virtual machine management)

                <p>This release adds support for the experimental virtual machine management app
                    introduced in Android 15 QPR2. It currently only provides support for managing a
                    single VM and interacting with it via a WebView-based terminal. Android is in
                    the process of adding support for graphics and GPU acceleration for a future
                    release. For now, it's only available in developer options due to being highly
                    experimental. We don't recommend using developer options on a production device,
                    but you can temporarily enable it to turn on this feature and turn them back off
                    without it being disabled like most developer options. The data inside it should
                    currently be treated as disposable rather than relying on it not losing it from
                    a bug or a backwards incompatible update. We plan to support choosing other
                    guest operating systems beyond the Debian-based image provided by Android along
                    with taking far more advantage of the virtualization infrastructure.

                <p>This release is based on Android 15 QPR2, the second quarterly release of Android
                    15. All of the supported devices are now using the Linux 6.1 LTS branch so the
                    5.10 and 5.15 branches are retired for GrapheneOS. 6.6 continues to be used for
                    microdroid virtual machines on devices and for emulator builds, which will
                    likely move to 6.12 this year.

                <ul>
                    <li>add opt-in GrapheneOS network location implementation available via Settings
                        &gt; Location &gt; Location services based on using the Apple Wi-Fi
                        positioning API either through a GrapheneOS proxy or directly via Apple's
                        service, which will be extended with much more functionality in the near
                        future including incorporating altitude into trilateration, using cell
                        towers if it provides a better estimate than Wi-Fi and using our own network
                        location database either via a service or offline database downloads (we're
                        in the process of building our own database initially based on collecting
                        most of the data from Apple's service and have already done a test run
                        obtaining essentially all the cell tower data along with lots of Wi-Fi data)
                    </li>
                    <li>fix Wi-Fi APEX issues preventing an OS network location service from doing
                        Wi-Fi scans without the INTERACT_ACROSS_USERS / INTERACT_ACROSS_USERS_FULL
                        privileged permissions
                    </li>
                    <li>Sandboxed Google Play compatibility layer: add support for using an OS
                        network location provider for the default enabled rerouting of Google Play
                        location requests to the OS location service
                    </li>
                    <li>add support for "5G only" and "4G or 5G only" modes in addition to our
                        existing "4G only" mode
                    </li>
                    <li>enable support for blocking callers not in Contacts</li>
                    <li>resolve regression for secondary user SMS in Android 15 QPR1 by enabling
                        partial upstream fix since we dropped this part of our fix for the issues
                        but the upstream fix wasn't actually active
                    </li>
                    <li>fix Storage Scopes / Contact Scopes app settings link not working for apps
                        in nested profiles in some cases
                    </li>

                        zeroed by the OS as part of a clean reboot or shutdown since there isn't

                        implemented by Pixel boot firmware since April 2024 for booting into

                        implemented our January 2024 reset attack protection proposal, so we need to

                <ul>
                    <li>reimplement our fix for an upstream audio routing regression in Android 15
                        QPR1 impacting sandboxed Android Auto and likely other apps to avoid
                        blocking another subset of apps from changing audio routing when granted
                        permission
                    </li>
                    <li>Sandboxed Google Play compatibility layer: add support for enabling Google's
                        credential service via Settings &gt; Passwords, passkeys &amp; accounts by
                        making it function as an unprivileged service (non-Chromium-based apps tend
                        to require this to use Google as the passkey service and it's needed by
                        certain apps for their Sign in with Google option despite Android intending
                        to fully support other credential services)
                    </li>
                    <li>Sandboxed Google Play compatibility layer: allow disabling all Play
                        Integrity API notifications instead of only disabling them per-app
                    </li>
                    <li>Sandboxed Google Play compatibility layer: override Play services update
                        owner value to the GrapheneOS App Store to fully handle updates for it
                        ourselves
                    </li>
                    <li>work around upstream Android issue caused by an optimization which was
                        adding a 10 second delay to certain setting changes before they kick in for
                        background system packages
                    </li>

                    </li>
                    <li>kernel (6.1): drop revert for upstream USB fix causing DisplayPort alternate
                        mode regression to test if it's still needed due to lots of other backported
                        changes
