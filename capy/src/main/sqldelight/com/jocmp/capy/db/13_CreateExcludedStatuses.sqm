-- excluded statuses are a way of tracking state
-- for statuses that have recently been updated, for
-- which the inverse action should be taken for all other
-- article_statuses. This ensures that article IDs are state
-- in the database as opposed to parameter state which
-- can only go up to 999 variables in SQLite
CREATE TABLE excluded_statuses (
    article_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    type TEXT,
    PRIMARY KEY (article_id, type)
);
